# Introduction
This repo includes the three computer network projects I did. The brief introduction of them are listed below:  
1. Use UDP to implement distributed file transfer, which means there are file chunks being transfered between multiple senders and requesters.  
2. Based on the first project, add a intermediate node called emulator to facilitate real-world network features such as delaying, packet queuing, packet dropping, etc.  
3. Based on all the previous projects, implement link state routing, and simulate trace route function to print out the shortest path between two nodes.

You can find details of the project in each directory.
